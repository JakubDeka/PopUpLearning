# PopUpLearning

Aim of this project is to create an app for learning french words.

All word records are stored in a database, which can be created via ```create_database.py``` and modified via ```database.py```. Running ```quiz_app.py``` enables quizing with added words, just word flashcards.

Both applications can be also used by running ```french_learning.py```, where one can select which tool to use.

# TODO

App is available only in polish language, though the english version is on the way (date unspecified).
